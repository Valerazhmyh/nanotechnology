      <h2 id="history"> Molecular biology </h2>
      <p> Molecular biology is the branch of biology that concerns the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms and interactions.
           The central dogma of molecular biology describes the process in which DNA is transcribed into RNA, then translated into protein.
           <br> Some clinical research and medical therapies arising from molecular biology are covered under gene therapy whereas the use of molecular biology or molecular cell biology in medicine is now referred to as molecular medicine.
            Molecular biology also plays important role in understanding formations, actions, and regulations of various parts of cells which can be used to efficiently target new drugs, diagnose disease, and understand the physiology of the cell.

            <h2 id="juke"> Microeletronics</h2>
            <p>Microelectronics is a branch of modern industry, the production of silicon crystals of integrated circuits. Microelectronics is an unshakable foundation not only for the entire modern information and computer technology industry, but also for many related industries - consumer electronics, the entertainment industry, medicine, the military and automotive industries, and so on.
               <br> There are two main directions of development of the chip industry. The first is the development of architecture, which includes the choice of certain functions and features of future circuits, microcircuitry and layout on the crystal of functional blocks and their elements that embody the selected functions. 
              <br>  And also - optimization of ready blocks for the purpose of elimination of bottlenecks, increase of productivity and reliability of work of the future schemes, simplification and reduction in price of their mass production. These works can be conditionally called "paper" - they are performed "on the tip of a pen" and exist only in the form of computer files and drawings of projects of future chips, which does not preclude multiple computer simulations of physical work as individual units and chips in in general. For this purpose special, carefully coordinated with real devices physical models of transistors and other functional elements are used. 
              <br> And the more carefully the project is modeled, the faster and with fewer errors the chip itself will be made . After all, debugging, finding and correcting design errors in a ready-made crystal, as a rule, is much more complicated and expensive than modeling on a computer.</p>

            <h2 id="Passat"> Colloidal chemistry </h2>
            <p>Colloid chemistry is the science of the highly dispersed state of matter and surface phenomena that occur at the phase boundary. One phase should not be dissolved in another.
                <br> This is a branch of chemistry in which the behavior of dispersed systems is studied. This includes the study of the nature and effects of the surface and interfacial boundaries on the macroscopic properties of substances. Such studies include the study of surface tension, interfacial tension (tension that exists on the surface of contact between a liquid and a solid or between two liquids), wetting and spreading of a liquid on a solid, 
                adsorption of gases and ions from solutions on solid surfaces, Brownian motion of suspended particles , emulsification, coagulation, etc.

            <h2 id="juke"> Microprocessor </h2>
            <p>A microprocessor is an integrated circuit that performs the functions of a central processing unit (CPU) or a specialized processor. Today, the word microprocessor is almost synonymous with the word processor, because the functional unit, which in the early stages of computer development took up an entire board or even a cabinet, now fits into one small integrated circuit with hundreds of millions of transistors inside.
                <br> A good example today is SoC. Since the mid-1980s, almost microprocessors have supplanted other types of CPUs, especially in the home. However, this is generally not the case: the CPUs of some supercomputers even today are complex complexes of large (BIS) and ultra-large (VLSI) integrated circuits.
                <br> Execution of this or that algorithm is possible in the presence of the microprocessor and devices in which the program is stored. It is known that a program is a set of commands (rules) that are executed in the sequence specified by the algorithm. 
                Commands are selected from memory in the sequence specified by the processor. The processor determines the addresses of the memory elements in which the required data is stored. The data is transmitted to the processor, where it is converted according to commands, and the results of the operation are transmitted back to memory.
                Any microprocessor system works together with a number of external devices, receiving from them the necessary information and transmitting another. <br> There is an interface for communication with external devices. This term refers to the whole set of devices, rules and technical means that regulate and ensure the exchange of information between the microprocessor and external devices. 
                The main ones in the interface are tires, or as they are often called, highways. A bus is a set of conductors for which the logic levels "0" and "1" are strictly normalized. </p>
