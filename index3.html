        <p class="" style="margin-left: 200px; margin-right: 800px;"> <strong> Nanotechnology, nanoscience</strong>- is the science and technology of colloidal systems, it is colloid chemistry, colloidal physics, molecular biology, all microelectronics. The fundamental difference between colloidal systems, which include: clouds, human blood, DNA and protein molecules, transistors, which make up microprocessors, is that the surface of such particles or huge molecules is millions of times larger than the volume of the particles themselves.
         Such particles occupy an intermediate position between true homogeneous solutions, alloys, and ordinary objects of the macroworld, such as: a table, a book, sand. <br> The behavior of such systems is very different from the behavior of true solutions and melts and from the objects of the macrocosm due to the highly developed surface. 
         Typically, such effects begin to play a significant role when the particle size is in the range of 1-100 nanometers; hence the substitution of sciences colloidal physics, chemistry, biology - the definitions of nanoscience and nanotechnology, in terms of the size of the objects in question.</p>

         <h2 class="second-title"> Provenance </h2>
         <div class="first-text">
        <p> The concepts that preceded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by physicist Richard Feynman in his speech There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, in which he described the possibility of synthesis by directly manipulating atoms. 
            The term "nanotechnology" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, although it has not been widely known.</p>

          <p><br> Inspired by the concepts expressed by Feynman, Eric Drexler in 1986 used the term "nanotechnology" in his book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, in which he proposed the idea of ​​a nanoscale "collector" who could build a copy of himself and other elements of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. 
            In addition, in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute to promote awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and their implications. </p> 
        <p><br> Thus, the emergence of nanotechnology in the 1980s was primarily due to the convergence of theoretical and social work of Drexler, who developed and popularized the conceptual framework for nanotechnology, as well as obvious experimental advances that drew additional general attention to the prospects of atomic control of matter. 
        In the 1980s, two major breakthroughs caused the rise of nanotechnology in the modern era.</p> 
    <br> <p>
        In early 2001, the field received increased scientific, political, and commercial attention, leading to controversy and progress. Disagreements arose over the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnology, as exemplified in a report by the Royal Society for Nanotechnology, which was resolved in a public debate between Drexler and Smolly in 2001 and 2003.
